Arduino ThingSpeak Weather Station
An Arduino project that sends temperature and humidity data to ThingSpeak 
with WiFi connectivity and RTC time synchronization.

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor and sends it to ThingSpeak 
cloud service. It includes WiFi connectivity, RTC time synchronization, and automatic data logging.

Hardware Requirements
Arduino board with WiFi (e.g., Arduino WiFi Rev4)

DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor

Real-Time Clock (RTC) module
